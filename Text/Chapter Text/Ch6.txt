## Ch6OP
[FarRight][LoadBrian][MidLeft][LoadSanders][Right][LoadWrys]
Mmm... this must be the place.[AN]
I can feel something's[N]
power in the air here.[AN]

[FarRight]
Good thing you can, sir.[N]
It's rather dark here...[AN]
Luckily, my eyes are[N]
sharp as a hawk's.[AN]

[MidLeft]
We'll have to do[N]
our best to naviagte.[AN]
I can hear the monsters[N]
shuffling about in the dark.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadArden]
I'll clear us a[N]
path. Let's move![A][X]



## Ch6WaterDrain
[MidLeft][LoadSanders]
The water...![N]
Stay on guard, everyone![AN]
They can attack us[N]
from all angles now![A][X]



## Ch6Vergil
[MidRight][LoadVergil]
So they were lurking[N]
in the sewers indeed...[AN]
Begone, foul demons![N]
I shall strike you down![A][X]



## Ch6Vergil2
[MidLeft][LoadSanders]
I recognize that imperial[N]
knight from somewhere...[AN]
It seems he doesn't[N]
notice we're here.[AN]
I'll just let him deal[N]
with those monsters.[A][X]



## Ch6OtakuGohard
[Left][LoadOtaku][FarLeft][LoadGohard]
Ugh! Isn't this[N]
just great...[AN]
My armor is soaked,[N]
and that smell...[AN]

[Left]
Try and focus. We've[N]
been through worse before.[AN]
If those monsters catch[N]
you off guard, then...[AN]

[FarLeft]
I can handle[N]
myself, you know![AN]

[Left]
I know that, but I can't help[N]
but be worried about you.[AN]

[FarLeft]
[Beat][AN]

[MidRight][LoadSanders]
Who are[N]
you two?[AN]

[Left]
Huh? What are you[N]
doing down here?[AN]

[MidRight]
I could ask[N]
you the same.[AN]

[Left]
We're looking for something.[AN]
I take it you're not allied[N]
with these monsters?[AN]

[MidRight]
Not a chance.[AN]

[Left]
How about we work[N]
together, then?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Ooh, new friends?[AN]
Let me see what[N]
you guys are made of![A][X]



## Ch6Ending
[Right][LoadWrys][FarRight][LoadOtaku][Left][LoadSanders][FarLeft][LoadWolt]
That was one[N]
big spider...![AN]

[Left]
Looks like he was holding[N]
onto something...[A][Event][N]
What do you think, Wrys?[N]
Look like a holy weapon?[AN]

[Right]
Ah, the holy lance, Gungnir.[AN]
I'm not sure you can[N]
make use of it yourself,[AN]
but it will serve one[N]
of your allies well.[AN]

[FarRight]
To think something like[N]
that was down here...[AN]

[FarLeft]
I can feel its[N]
power from here.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadFinn]
In fact, it might be[N]
a little too powerful.[AN]
With all these monsters[N]
still around...[AN]

[FarRight]
It'll draw them[N]
right to us.[AN]
We should be[N]
getting out of here.[AN]

[Left]
Right. Onwards, then.[A][X]


## Ch6ItemGet
[MidRight][LoadGohard]
Otaku!! Hey!![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadOtaku]
Gohard...[N]
did you find it?[AN]

[MidRight]
Sure did! It's still[N]
in one piece too![AN]
Here, take it.[AN]

[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]

[MidRight]
Is... something wrong?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Why don't you hold[N]
onto it for now?[AN]

[MidRight]
Ehhh?! Isn't this scroll[N]
really important to you?[AN]

[MidLeft]
It is. It's supposed to keep[N]
you safe if you hold onto it.[AN]
So, I want you to keep it.[AN]

[MidRight]
Otaku...[A][X]


## Ch6VergilDeath
[MidRight][LoadVergil]
Tsk...![AN]
I got carried away.[N]
I shall retreat, then.[A][X]


## Ch6Ending2
[MidRight][LoadVergil]
Those mercenaries...[N]
To think I'd see them again here.[AN]
And with holy weapons, no less.[N]
I'll need to think this over...[A][X]



## Ch6BossWarning
[MidRight][LoadBrian]
Hm... My finely tuned ears[N]
are picking up something...[AN]
[Red]rather large [Red]approaching[N]
here from that hallway.[AN]
Perhaps we should start[N]
heading towards it?[A][X]
