## Ch10OP
[MidLeft][LoadSanders][FarRight][LoadKy][Right][LoadDerek]
Seems we're here.[N]
Notice the tents?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah. There looks to[N]
be about five of them.[AN]

[Right]
The weapon supplies[N]
are stored inside.[AN]
If we can take out the tents,[AN]
it should prevent the[N]
imperials from reinforcing.[AN]

[FarRight]
Each tent seems to be[N]
holding specific units.[AN]
We should consider which[N]
we want to destroy first...[A][X]



## Ch10OP2
[MidLeft][LoadTodoroki]
So, they came this[N]
way after all.[AN]
Alright, men! They shall[N]
go no further![A][X]



## Ch10JasonArle
[FarRight][LoadArle][Right][LoadJason]
You alright, Arle?[AN]

[FarRight]
Yeah, I think so...[AN]
I wasn't expecting those[N]
guys to start attacking us![AN]
What's their problem?[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadSanders]
These imperials giving[N]
you a hard time?[AN]

[Right]
We passed through here[N]
last time no problem.[AN]
Did something happen?[AN]

[MidLeft]
That... may be our fault.[AN]
Either way, if you guys[N]
need to get through here,[AN]
your best bet may be[N]
to stick with us.[AN]

[FarRight]
Hey, thanks![AN]
We can help out[N]
too, right Jason?[AN]

[Right]
Prepped for combat.[AN]
Just tell me[N]
where to aim![A][X]



## Ch10TodorokiBattle
[MidLeft][LoadTodoroki]
You bunch again...[AN]
Let's see if you[N]
can keep up![A][X]

## Ch10TodorokiDeath
[MidLeft][LoadTodoroki]
Heh, just as good[N]
as I remembered...[A][X]


## Ch10Ending
[FarLeft][LoadArle][Left][LoadSanders][FarRight][LoadMilanor][Right][LoadDerek]
That ought to slow them down enough.[N]
We can get through without much trouble.[AN]

[Left]
Great. Then let's get going.[AN]
I'm starting to get[N]
sick of all this snow.[AN]

[FarRight]
But where are we[N]
going after this?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Well, me and Jason were going to head down[N]
to a temple by the base of the mountain.[AN]
Maybe you could join us?[AN]

[Left]
Sounds like something[N]
worth checking out.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadWrys]
You're supposing another[N]
weapon could be there?[AN]

[FarLeft]
A weapon...[AN]
I think we heard something about[N]
that when we were asking around.[AN]

[FarRight]
Sounds like a[N]
good lead then.[AN]

[Left]
Looks like we're taking[N]
you two there then.[AN]
Let's move.[A][X]
