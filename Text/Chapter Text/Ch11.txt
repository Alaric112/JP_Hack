How're things[N]
coming along?[AN]

It seems we're[N]
making good time.[AN]
We should arrive at[N]
port in a few days.[AN]

[FarRight]
Thank goodness.[AN]
I'm starting to[N]
get seasick...[AN]

[Right]
Seasickness? I might[N]
have something for that...[AN]

[FarLeft]
What's up with that[N]
black haired guy?[AN]

Pay him no mind.[AN]
He's reliable,[N]
for the right price.[AN]

[Left]
Something about him...[AN]
I feel like we're[N]
similar, somehow.[AN]

You and him, brother?[AN]
I can't see it. You're[N]
like night and day.[AN]

girl with the headband around?[AN]

I can go[N]
get her.[AN]

Right, let's go.[AN]

[MidLeft]
No.[AN]

them right.[AN]

[Right]
What a waste[N]
of time...[AN]

[Left]

alright, captain?[AN]

[FarLeft][Clear][LoadPaniel]
Everything looks to be in good shape.[N]
But what the heck was that all about?[AN]
There aren't usually pirates[N]
around this close to the shore.[AN]

[FarRight]
I've been having a bad feeling.[AN]
I thought it was nothing, but...[N]
We may be in for trouble when we land.[AN]
