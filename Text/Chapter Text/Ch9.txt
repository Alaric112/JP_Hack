Chapter 9: In the Basement[X]

## Ch9Objective
Escape[X]



## Ch9OP
[Left][LoadSanders][FarLeft][LoadMilanor]
...Something[N]
seems off.[AN]

[Left]
What's wrong?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Usually by now we would[N]
have met with someone.[AN]

[Right][LoadFinn][FarRight][LoadOtaku]
Seems like a bad[N]
sign, then.[AN]

[Right]
Should we get[N]
prepared?[AN]

[Left]
Always better[N]
to be cautious.[AN]

[FarLeft]
I hope everyone's[N]
alright...[A][X]



## Ch9OP2
[Left][LoadVergil][FarLeft][LoadDerek][MidRight][LoadGromell]
Hahaha! Looks like that intel we[N]
got was on the mark after all.[AN]

[Left]
Right you are. This will remove[N]
a major thorn in our side.[AN]

[MidRight]
Alright, men! These are[N]
enemies of the Empire![AN]
For too long have[N]
they interfered![AN]
We shall rid ourselves[N]
of that monster scourge![AN]
We shall obtain[N]
those holy weapons![AN]
Show no mercy![AN]
[Clear]

[FarLeft]
[Beat][AN]

[Left]
...Derek, you've seemed off ever[N]
since that caravan mission.[AN]

[FarLeft]
That man I fought...[N]
who was he?[AN]

[Left]
I don't have answers[N]
for you, Derek.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Yes... and neither[N]
did Lord Raydrik...[A][X]




## Ch9OP3
[MidLeft][LoadEevster][MidRight][LoadKy]
Eev! Are you[N]
alright?![AN]

[MidLeft]
For now, yes...[N]
But the guards...[AN]

[MidRight]
...I'm afraid[N]
there's no time.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Right...[A][X]




## Ch9OP4
[MidLeft][LoadEevster][MidRight][LoadKy]
Shit, the gates![AN]
They must have figured[N]
out our mechanism already...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Then we'll have to[N]
stand our ground.[AN]

[MidRight]
It's a deathtrap.[AN]
Looks like we've played[N]
right into their hands.[AN]

[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]

[MidRight]
Whatever happens here...[N]
It's been an honor, Eev.[AN]
Alright, guys![N]
We hold here![A][X]




## Ch9OP5
[MidLeft][LoadSanders][MidRight][LoadMilanor]
I wasn't expecting things[N]
to be this bad...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Guess things can never[N]
go our way, huh.[AN]
Looks like we're[N]
helping you out again.[A][X]




## Ch9DerekTurns
[MidLeft][LoadDerek][MidRight][LoadVergil]
I understand that look in your eyes.[N]
You need answers, don't you?[AN]

[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]

[MidRight]
If you go, there's no turning back.[AN]
I won't stop you here, but...[N]
Eventually, our blades will cross.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Thank you, sir Vergil.[N]
It's been an honor.[AN]

[MidRight]
Find your destiny.[A][X]





## Ch9DerekTurns2
[MidLeft][LoadDerek][MidRight][LoadEevster]
Your blade[N]
is sheathed...[AN]

[MidLeft]
I'm not here to fight you.[N]
If I may, allow me to protect you.[AN]

[MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadKy]
You're the enemy.[AN]
Give me one good[N]
reason to trust you.[AN]

[Right]
Do we have[N]
much choice?[AN]

[FarRight]
...One false move,[N]
and it's your head.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I understand.[A][X]



## Ch9TurnOne
[MidLeft][LoadSanders]
Yandahl and Milanor told me[N]
about the gate mechanism.[AN]
As I understand it,[AN]
we're going to need to hit both[N]
switches to open the doors.[A][X]


## Ch9TurnOne2
[MidLeft][LoadSanders]
There's way too many of[N]
them for us to handle,[AN]
so we should just hurry[N]
out of here after that.[A][X]



## Ch9GromellTalks
[MidRight][LoadGromell]
Looks like they're putting[N]
up more fight than I expected...[AN]
Call in for the elites![N]
We'll crush them with force![A][X]


## Ch9RaydrikMoves
[MidRight][LoadRaydrik]
Useless pawns...[AN]
Looks like I must dispose[N]
of these vermin myself.[A][X]


## Ch9Recruitment
[Right][LoadEevster][FarRight][LoadDerek][MidLeft][LoadSanders]
Looks like you're[N]
still in one piece.[AN]

[Right]
I don't go down[N]
that easily.[AN]

[MidLeft]
And what are you[N]
doing here?[AN]

[FarRight]
Peace, friend.[AN]
I seek no[N]
quarrel with you.[AN]

[MidLeft]
So you're[N]
helping us now?[AN]
I'll be keeping my[N]
eyes on you, then.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadKy]
We can converse[N]
more later.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Right. Let's move.[A][X]


## Ch9Ending
[FarLeft][LoadKy][Right][LoadEevster][FarRight][LoadDerek][Left][LoadSanders]
Is everyone[N]
alright?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Looks like we've[N]
mostly made it out.[AN]

[Right]
What a disaster...[AN]

[Left]
And you...[AN]

[FarRight]
I'm sure you remember.[AN]
Back with the caravans.[N]
That... man.[AN]

[Left]
He seemed hell-bent on[N]
killing anyone in his path.[AN]

[FarRight]
It's more than that.[N]
He seemed... unhuman.[AN]

[Right]
I've heard a bit about this.[AN]
Something the empire does with[N]
black magic behind closed doors.[AN]

[FarRight]
So it's as I feared...[AN]

[Right]
Well, it's all just[N]
rumors and speculation.[AN]
We haven't been able to find[N]
any reliable source about it...[AN]

[FarLeft]
We should probably[N]
focus on moving forwards.[AN]
No doubt they're[N]
following close behind.[AN]

[Left]
Right. Let's get[N]
going then.[AN]

[FarRight]
You may want to prepare ahead.[AN]
There's an imperial encampment[N]
not too far down the road.[AN]

[FarLeft]
More fighting, then.[N]
Allow me to lend my blade.[A][X]



## Ch9Ending2
[Left][LoadGromell][FarLeft][LoadVergil][MidRight][LoadRaydrik]
So they've escaped[N]
once more...[AN]

[Left]
Apologies,[N]
lord Raydrik...[AN]
I underestimated[N]
their abilities.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Fear not.[AN]
The route is blocked[N]
by our encampment.[AN]
They'll be walking[N]
back into our hands.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hmph. Very well.[N]
You are both dismissed.[AN]

[Left][Clear][FarLeft][Clear]

[MidRight]
Another failure.[AN]

[MidLeft][ToggleColorInvert]
Fear not, lord Raydrik.[AN]
The ultimate power will[N]
soon be in your hands.[AN]
Then you can be rid of[N]
those that would oppose you.[AN]
[ToggleColorInvert]

[MidRight]
Yes...[N]
Yes, you are right.[AN]
I shall carry out[N]
the dark ritual.[AN]
And then...[A][X]


## Ch9VergilBattle
[MidLeft][LoadVergil]
So you would be foolish[N]
enough to challenge me?[AN]
En garde![A][X]

## Ch9VergilDeath
[MidLeft][LoadVergil]
Impossible...[AN]
You've grown[N]
this strong...?[A][X]

## Ch9GromellBattle
[MidLeft][LoadGromell]
Looking for a challenge?[N]
Ha! You've got guts, kid.[AN]
Bring it on, then![A][X]

## Ch9GromellDeath
[MidLeft][LoadGromell]
N-no way...[AN]
Looks like I'll[N]
have to back out...[A][X]

## Ch9RaydrikBattle
[MidLeft][LoadRaydrik]
You shall bend before my will.[N]
Begone from my sight, pawn![A][X]

## Ch9RaydrikDeath
[MidLeft][LoadRaydrik]
Hmph. A foolish effort.[A][X]
