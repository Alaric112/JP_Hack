## Ch8OP
[Left][LoadYandahl][FarLeft][LoadSanders]
It's freezing out here...[AN]
I don't think we can[N]
be outside much longer.[AN]

[Left]
Not to worry. We have a[N]
cabin out this way as well.[AN]
We should be about there.[AN]

[FarLeft]
I think I see it...[A][X]



## Ch8OP2
[Left][LoadYandahl][FarLeft][LoadSanders]
It's much warmer in[N]
here, thankfully.[AN]

[FarRight][LoadKohaku][Right][LoadMilanor]
Ho! Yandahl![AN]
Good to see you[N]
still in one piece![AN]
Who are these folks?[AN]

[Left]
These are Sanders[N]
and his friends.[AN]

[Right]
Ohh, the guys who bailed[N]
out the boss, right?[AN]
Pleasure to meetcha! I'm Milanor.[N]
Make yourselves comfortable.[AN]
It's no castle, but it's a heck[N]
of lot warmer than out there.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Thank you. We could[N]
use some rest.[AN]

[FarRight]
I'll go prepare[N]
some tea...[AN]

[Right]
Shouldn't you introduce[N]
yourself first, Kohaku?[A][X]



## Ch8OP3
[MidRight][LoadBit][MidLeft][LoadTim]
My my, so snowy[N]
and dark out here...[AN]
One can barely see.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hur hur! Perfect for[N]
causin' trouble, right bro?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Why, right you are, Bit.[N]
But oh, what trouble to cause...[AN]

[MidRight]
Hurr... we could smash up some houses![N]
That one down there looks pretty fancy![AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmm, you think so?[AN]
Well, who am I to[N]
challenge my dear brother...[AN]
Alright, boys![N]
You heard the man![AN]

[MidRight]
Huzzah![A][X]



## Ch8OP4
[Right][LoadSanders][FarRight][LoadMilanor][MidLeft][LoadGuts]
Hate to interrupt your fun,[N]
but you better gear up.[AN]

[FarRight]
Huh? What's[N]
up, Guts?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Bandits. From the looks of it,[N]
they're charging right down here.[AN]

[FarRight]
Wha...?![AN]
Bandits? All the way out here?[N]
You've gotta be pullin' my leg...[AN]

[Right]
We can help out.[AN]

[FarRight]
Are you sure?[AN]
You guys still[N]
need to rest...[AN]

[Right]
It can wait. Besides, clearing out[N]
this crowd is our speciality.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You all go ahead. Kohaku,[N]
can you get my armor?[AN]

[MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadKohaku]
Yes, I'll have it[N]
prepared as fast as I can.[AN]

[FarRight]
Argh, alright![N]
Where's my damned axe?[A][X]



## Ch8MilanorJoins
[MidRight][LoadMilanor]
I'll teach these jokers what[N]
a real bandit looks like![AN]
Let's see, who's carrying[N]
around anything valuable...?[A][X]



## Ch8GutsKohakuJoin
[MidRight][LoadGuts]
Sorry for the delay.[AN]
Allow me to cleave a[N]
path through these fools.[AN]
They will tremble[N]
in fear before me.[AN]
[Clear][LoadKohaku]
I am bound to serve.[AN]
If you need help, I am[N]
more than happy to assist.[A][X]



## Ch8TimBattle
[MidLeft][LoadTim]
My, my... I wasn't expecting[N]
a pack of mercenaries.[AN]
I do so enjoy a twist![N]
Allow me to show my mettle.[A][X]

## Ch8TimDeath
[MidLeft][LoadTim]
Impressive...[AN]
I applaud you![N]
Magnifique![A][X]

## Ch8BitBattle
[MidLeft][LoadBit]
Hur hur, you guys are tough![N]
I like that! Me next! Me next![A][X]

## Ch8BitDeath
[MidLeft][LoadBit]
Aww, I think I lost...[AN]
But I'll win next time![N]
Hur hur hur![A][X]



## Ch8Village1
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent][MidRight][LoadOldMan]
Ah, greetings, youngling.[N]
It's quite dark out there...[AN]
I don't know that you should[N]
head out there without a light.[AN]
Oh, I know! Here, take this.[AN]
It's supposed to contain[N]
the power of the sun.[AN]
May it guide your way.[A][X]

## Ch8Village2
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent][MidRight][LoadKelikGirl]
You, mercenaries...[N]
Here, take this...[AN]
It contains the[N]
burden of a lost soul.[AN]
It is a very[N]
potent magic item...[AN]
Use it well.[A][X]


## Ch8TimBitCharge
[MidLeft][LoadTim]
Those goons are taking[N]
up my precious time...[AN]
I suppose I must do[N]
the work myself.[AN]
[Clear]
[MidRight][LoadBit]
Rrr... I'm so bored![N]
I'm gonna go join the fun![A][X]



## Ch8TurnOne
[MidLeft][LoadSanders]
If we can find and defeat their[N]
leaders, they should disperse.[AN]
Easier said than done[N]
in this weather, though...[A][X]



## Ch8Ending
[Left][LoadSanders][FarLeft][LoadYandahl][Right][LoadMilanor][FarRight][LoadGuts]
Looks like the remaining[N]
cowards are fleeing.[AN]

[Right]
About time! Bunch of[N]
good for nothings...[AN]

[FarLeft]
Should we head back[N]
inside, then?[A][X]


## Ch8Ending2
[FarLeft][LoadYandahl][FarRight][LoadGuts][Left][LoadSanders][Right][LoadMilanor]
Well, now that[N]
that's taken care of,[AN]
feel free to rest here[N]
until this storm blows over.[AN]

[Left]
We will, thanks.[AN]

[FarRight]
You taking these guys[N]
to the base, Yandahl?[AN]

[FarLeft]
That was the plan.[AN]

[Right]
Well then, allow us to[N]
join you on the way.[AN]

[Left]
Are you sure?[AN]

[Right]
Yeah, you guys helped us[N]
out, so it's only fair.[AN]
We needed to be heading[N]
back soon anyways.[AN]
Two birds, one stone![AN]

[Left]
Thanks, then. But first...[N]
I need to get some sleep.[A][X]
