## PrologueOP
[MidRight][LoadSanders]
[Beat]
It seems so peaceful[N]
here. I wonder...[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
My, you've grown into[N]
such a fine young man.[AN]

[MidRight]
Huh...?[N]
Is that...[AN]
Is that you...?[N]
...Mom?[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Oh, you still recognize me![N]
I'm so glad, Sanders.[AN]
I was worried you would forget.[AN]

[MidRight]
Mom... how could[N]
I forget you?[AN]
It's... been so long.[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
While I would love more than[N]
anything to chat with you,[AN]
it seems it's almost time.[AN]

[MidRight]
Time? Time[N]
for what?[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
[Beat]
Sanders, dear, I need to warn you.[N]
The road ahead of you will be long.[AN]
And it won't be easy. There are[N]
times you'll want to give up.[AN]
But you have to keep trying.[AN]
And, more than anything,[N]
you can lean on your friends.[AN]

[MidRight]
I don't understand[N]
what you mean, but...[AN]
If there's something[N]
you need me to do,[AN]
then you just have to ask.[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Such a caring boy...[AN]
Maybe I was getting[N]
worried for nothing.[AN]
Sanders, I need you[N]
to wake up, okay?[AN]

[MidRight]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A][X]





## PrologueOP2
[MidRight][LoadSanders][CloseEyes]
Zzz...[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadScott]
Sanders...[N]
Sanders![AN]

[MidRight]
[OpenEyes]
Hmm? I'm up,[N]
I'm up...[AN]

[Event]

[MidLeft]
Pick up the pace,[N]
we've got trouble![AN]

[MidRight]
Trouble?[AN]

[MidLeft]
A bunch of bandits just docked[N]
their boat into the port,[AN]
and started ransacking the town![AN]

[MidRight]
Well, bollocks. Go get Finn[N]
and Marisa. I'll grab my sword.[AN]

[MidLeft]
On it![AN]
[Clear]

[MidRight]
...Almost[N]
time, huh.[A][X]




## PrologueOP3
[Left][LoadMarisa][MidRight][LoadSanders]
You brought[N]
her along?[AN]

[Left]
Well, I can't very well[N]
leave her own her own, can I?[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadRenge]
I can help too...[N]
If you get hurt...[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadFinn]
I'm not comfortable with[N]
it either, but she's right.[AN]
Besides, these tonics work much[N]
less effectively than a staff.[AN]

[MidRight]
I guess she's safer[N]
with us than by herself...[AN]
Alright, fine. But[N]
keep close to me, okay?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Okay...[A][X]



## PrologueOP4
[Left][LoadRedSoldier][FarLeft][LoadBrigand][MidRight][LoadBatta]
Alright, you lot![N]
Let's get moving![AN]

nobody no mercy, ya hear?[AN]

[Left]
Yes sir![AN]
[Clear]

[MidRight]
You there! Brigand boy![N]
You're on collection duty, got it?[AN]
Go grab any valuables you see![N]
Burn the houses down if you have to![AN]

[FarLeft]
You got[N]
it, boss![AN]
[Clear]

[MidRight]
This oughta be a cinch.[AN]
Nobody stands up[N]
to Batta the Beast![A][X]



## PrologueHint1
[MidRight][LoadScott]
Oskar and Blanc might be[N]
in trouble on their own.[AN]
We should go warn them[N]
about these brigands.[AN]
I think they lived in[N]
the house down there...[A][X]




## PrologueOskarBlancHouse
[FarRight][LoadBlanc][Right][LoadOskar]
Hmhmmhmm...[AN]

[MoveMidLeft]
There you are.[AN]
Would you like[N]
some water too?[AN]
[Clear][LoadOskar][MoveRight]
Oh, such a pretty[N]
flower you're blooming![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadCurrent]

[Right][Clear][LoadOskar]
Oh, hey. What's up?[AN]
...Bandits? Oh, shoot![N]
Blanc! Blanc!! Hey!![AN]

[FarRight]
...You know how I feel about[N]
being interrupted, right?[AN]

[Right]
No time for that![N]
The town is under attack![AN]

[FarRight]
Under attack? Crap![AN]
Why didn't you just[N]
say so? Let's go![A][X]




## PrologueOskarBlancAfterRecruit
[MidLeft][LoadOskar]
Alright, leave the[N]
heavy hitting to me![AN]
I'll teach these punks[N]
to mess with my plants![AN]

[Clear][LoadBlanc]
I'll take out my[N]
rage on them...[AN]
Get ready!![A][X]




## PrologueHouse1
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent][MidRight][LoadOldMan]
Oh dear me, these men[N]
seem like trouble...[AN]
Thank you for protecting[N]
me and my home from them.[AN]
Please, take this.[AN]
Were it not for you,[N]
I'd have nothing left,[AN]
so please accept it.[A][X]




## PrologueHouse2
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent][MidRight][LoadVillagerGirl]
Eep! Huh...?[N]
You guys aren't bandits...[AN]
Thank goodness.[N]
Here, take this.[AN]
I used to study a[N]
bit of magic, but...[AN]
I gave up after I seared[N]
my friend's hair off.[A][X]



## PrologueBattaBattle
[MidLeft][LoadBatta]
Who in the heck[N]
are you guys?![AN]
Argh, well, it[N]
doesn't matter.[AN]
I'll kick you[N]
outta here myself![A][X]




## PrologueBattaDeath
[MidLeft][LoadBatta]
Damn, too strong...[AN]
If ya think this is the[N]
last of Batta's Beasts,[AN]
Yer sorely mistaken![A][X]




## PrologueEnding
[Left][LoadScott][FarLeft][LoadOskar][MidRight][LoadSanders]
Looks like we finally[N]
drove them off.[AN]

[Left]
What a fight.[AN]
I'm gonna have to train harder[N]
if I want to protect the people...[AN]

[FarLeft]
The important part is[N]
that everyone is safe.[AN]
My plants, too.[N]
Thanks, guys.[AN]

[Clear][LoadFinn]
Unfortunately,[N]
I've got bad news.[AN]
Looks like this wasn't[N]
an isolated incident.[AN]

[MidRight]
The other towns[N]
too, then?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Yeah. Looks like we've[N]
got another job, at least.[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, it was nice working[N]
in this town and all...[AN]

[MoveRight][FarRight][LoadMarisa]
No way, buster. We're[N]
coming with you.[AN]

[Left]
I'd never leave[N]
people in need behind![AN]

[FarLeft][Clear][LoadBlanc]
And I've still got a lot[N]
of anger to work out.[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadRenge]
Yay, travel...[AN]

[Right]
Alright, alright.[AN]
It's not like I could[N]
stop you all anyways.[AN]
Lead the way, Finn.[AN]

[FarLeft][Clear][LoadFinn]
Let's make haste, then.[A][X]
