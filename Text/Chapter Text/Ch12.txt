Chapter 12: Forces of Darkness[X]

## Ch12Objective
Defeat Boss[X]



## Ch12OP
[MidLeft][LoadPaniel]
Say, boss...[AN]

[MidRight][LoadDonnalen]
Hm? Is something[N]
the matter, captain?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Well, we're pulling[N]
into port now, but...[AN]
There's not a soul around.[AN]

[MidRight]
I see...[AN]

[CloseSpeech][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadSchezo]
As I feared, then.[AN]
Tell everyone to[N]
ready their weapons.[AN]

[Right]
Tsk. I knew those things[N]
were on the loose here,[AN]
but for them to be this[N]
far from the mainland?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Things?[N]
What things?[AN]

[CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadDevvy]
...Monsters. Heh.[AN]
Maybe this will be more[N]
interesting than I thought.[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadAnabelle]
Everyone's ready, brother.[N]
We await your orders![AN]

[Right]
Right. Move out![A][X]



## Ch12OP2
[MidLeft][LoadDarkMarlen]
Heheheh... this place[N]
has been easy pickings.[AN]
I guess you were right[N]
about this after all.[AN]
Those imperials are so[N]
busy with themselves,[AN]
they haven't bothered[N]
to check up here at all.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadZane]
I wouldn't lie to you, Marlen.[N]
We're allies after all, right?[AN]
Make good use of my... friends.[AN]
I'm still experimenting with[N]
how powerful I can create them.[AN]

[MidLeft]
A lot of weaklings, or[N]
one murdereous creature...[AN]
Well, I'll leave those[N]
dark arts books to you.[AN]
I was never much for[N]
reading myself, anyways.[AN]

[MidRight]
Right. Do enjoy[N]
yourself, Marlen![AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
Oh, don't you worry[N]
about that. I will.[AN]
Heheh... Ahahahah!![A][X]



## Ch12PostPrep
[MidLeft][LoadSchezo]
Some of these zombies seem[N]
attracted to those tents...[AN]
I don't know what's in there,[N]
but it can't be anything good.[AN]
We'll have to [Red]stop them[Red][N]
before they can get there.[A][X]



## Ch12ValerieSadao
[Right][LoadValerie]
My, my... look at all these[N]
little toys we have here.[AN]

[FarRight][LoadSadao]
These beserk demons...[AN]
don't they know who[N]
they're dealing with?[AN]

[Right]
Heheh, your little uniform[N]
isn't helping matters, "Sadao".[AN]

[FarRight]
You really don't know when[N]
to shut your mouth, huh?[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadDonnalen]
...I take it you two aren't[N]
with these monsters, then.[AN]

[FarRight]
They should be, if they[N]
had any damned respect...[AN]
What is with this blasted[N]
summoning magic anyways?[AN]

[Right]
Ignore him, please.[AN]
If you're here to slice[N]
these things open too,[AN]
then we may have a[N]
common goal here.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Right. I'm just not[N]
going to ask...[A][X]



## Ch12Village1
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent]
Nobody's around. Hm...?[N]
Some kind of holy trinket.[AN]
Heh, a lot of good this did[N]
against those monsters, huh.[A][X]




## Ch12Village2
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent]
What a gruesome scene...[AN]
Looks like they tried to[N]
defend themselves with this.[A][X]



## Ch12Village3
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent]
A magic staff? It feels like an[N]
ill omen for things to come...[A][X]



## Ch12DarkMarlenBattle
[MidLeft][LoadDarkMarlen]
What the heck...?![N]
Who are you people?[AN]
You would dare oppose[N]
the master's will...?[AN]
You must die!![A][X]



## Ch12DarkMarlenDeath
[MidLeft][LoadDarkMarlen]
Th-this cannot be...[N]
But... hehe... hahaha![AN]
You mortals cannot slay me![N]
I shall be back...[A][X]



## Ch12Ending
[Right][LoadDonnalen][FarRight][LoadSchezo][FarLeft][LoadGinko][Left][LoadSadao]
This does not[N]
bode well...[AN]

[FarRight]
Do you know something[N]
of these demons?[AN]

[Left]
...You could say that.[AN]
They seem to be out[N]
of their right minds.[AN]

[Right]
Do such things[N]
have right minds?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Well, it's not like they can[N]
just spawn from thin air.[AN]
Something's gotta be fishy.[AN]
And I didn't like the talk of[N]
that red eyed fellow either.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadDevvy]
This is all irrelevant[N]
to our task here.[AN]
If they get in our[N]
way, we cut them down.[AN]

[Right]
Right. Will you[N]
two be joining us?[AN]
We're heading to the[N]
fortress due north.[AN]

[Left]
I have a feeling you bunch will[N]
be close to the heart of this.[AN]
It's better to travel together.[AN]

[FarLeft][Clear][LoadValerie]
More slaying, hm? Sounds[N]
delightful! Count me in.[AN]

[Right]
Then let's get going.[A][X]
