[Left][LoadTodoroki][FarLeft][LoadEevster]
H-hey, c'mon,[N]
let me go![AN]

[Left]
Yeah, right.[AN]
I'll give you a[N]
lollipop too.[AN]

[FarLeft]
This is just a big[N]
misunderstanding![AN]
You've got yourself the[N]
wrong girl, mister.[AN]
Do I really look old enough[N]
to be leading anything?[AN]

[Left]
It seems looks[N]
can be decieving.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadDerek]
Ah, Todoroki.[N]
Is this her?[AN]

[Left]
In the flesh.[AN]

[FarLeft]
It's not me![AN]
I don't even know what[N]
this "basement" thing is![AN]

[Left]
Don't listen to her.[AN]

[MidRight]
I trust you.[AN]
Excuse me, can I[N]
get a guard here?[AN]

[MoveRight][FarRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Yes, sir![AN]
Do you need me to escort[N]
the prisoner to her cell?[AN]

[Left]
Please. Her whining[N]
is unbearable.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][FarLeft][Clear]
[FarFarLeft]
Let me[N]
goooo![AN]

[Right]
If it's really her,[AN]
then at least we won't need[N]
to put up with their meddling.[AN]

[Left]
Right. And that means we can[N]
focus on finding those weapons.[AN]
Any luck with that holy sword?[AN]

[Right]
Unfortunately not.[AN]
A bunch of mercenaries showed[N]
up and took me by surprise.[AN]
It seems I was careless.[AN]

[Left]
Don't sweat it[N]
too bad, kid.[AN]
You're still new.[AN]
You should head[N]
on back for now.[AN]
I'll take over here.[AN]

[Right]
Yeah. I'll just go outside[N]
and get Missy ready then.[AN]

[Left]
...Missy?[AN]

[Right]
[Beat][AN]
It's...[N]
That's my horse.[AN]

[Left][CloseEyes]
[Beat]
I see.[A][X]



## Ch4OP2
[Right][LoadSanders][FarRight][LoadNeptune][MidLeft][LoadOskar]
Man, it's nice to see[N]
some sunlight again![AN]
I'm sure the plants[N]
appreciate it too.[AN]

[FarRight]
No more creepy[N]
monsters... finally![AN]

[Right]
...Is that man[N]
heading towards us?[AN]

[MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadGreenSoldier]
Excuse me, sir![AN]
You wouldn't happen to be[N]
a Mr. Sanders, would you?[AN]

[Right]
That's me, but... how[N]
do you know my name?[AN]

[FarLeft]
We have our ways of[N]
gathering information.[AN]
[Beat][AN]
But, we're not[N]
against you or anything![AN]
I was actually hoping to[N]
ask for your assistance.[AN]

[FarRight]
Well, what's the[N]
matter, Greenie?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Er, my name is Frankie...[AN]
Anyways, our leader was recently[N]
captured by the imperials.[AN]
She's being held in a fort[N]
nearby, but not for long.[AN]
If we can break her out here,[AN]
it'll be much easier than if she[N]
was taken to the Imperial castle.[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadFinn]
And I assume you're offering[N]
some reward for this...?[AN]

[FarLeft]
We don't have much[N]
in the way of funds...[AN]
But what we do have[N]
is information.[AN]
Information that may be[N]
of great interest to you.[AN]

[Right]
Go on.[AN]

[FarLeft]
About the Imperials,[N]
and about those holy weapons.[AN]
I've been told you're[N]
already in possesion of one.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadWrys]
If they know that much, then[N]
I think they may have merit.[AN]
What do you think?[AN]

[Right]
You may be on to something.[N]
Alright, Greenie.[AN]
We'll help you out in[N]
exchange for this information.[AN]
Lead the way.[AN]

[FarLeft]
R-right! Thank you![N]
Please, follow me![A][X]



## Ch4OP3
[MidLeft][LoadTodoroki][MidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Sir! Urgent news![AN]
It seems some mercenaries[N]
are approaching the fort![AN]
They're armed as well![AN]

[MidLeft]
Mercenaries...?[N]
It couldn't be...[AN]
Alright, inform the men[N]
to take defensive position![AN]

[MidRight]
Yes, sir![AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
Been a while since[N]
I've had a challenge...[AN]
If they really defeated Derek,[N]
I might finally have some fun...[A][X]



## Ch4OpenCell
[MidRight][LoadSanders][MidLeft][LoadEevster]
What the...[N]
who are you?[AN]

[MidRight]
We're the ones here[N]
to break you out.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, Mr. Sanders, is it?[N]
Heheh, thanks, bub.[AN]
We'll be taking our leave, then.[N]
I don't leave any debts unpaid.[A][X]




## Ch4OpenCell2
[MidRight][LoadGreenSoldier]
Thank you! We'll be[N]
heading to the exit now.[A][X]



## Ch4SandersBrianTalk
[MidRight][LoadBrian][MidLeft][LoadSanders]
Hey, gutso. Shouldn't you[N]
be escaping with the others?[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, I very well could be.[AN]
However, as a gentleman,[AN]
I feel uneasy turning tail when[N]
I'm in such pristine condition.[AN]

[MidLeft]
...Right.[AN]

[MidRight]
To put it simply, my friend,[AN]
I wish to fight alongside[N]
you and your noble posse.[AN]
My, how you say... abilities,[N]
may be of some use to you.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I'm a little busy at the moment,[N]
so I won't exactly stop you.[AN]
Just make sure to pull your weight.[AN]

[MidRight]
A great task for a great man![N]
I shall not disappoint, sir.[A][X]



## Ch4PostPrep
[MidLeft][LoadDerek]
Whoa, easy, girl![AN]

[MidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Sir, your Rapier.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Ah, thank you.[AN]
We should be ready[N]
to ride soon.[AN]
Inform the others[N]
for me, please.[AN]

[MidRight]
Right away![A][X]



## Ch4DerekLeaves
[MidLeft][LoadDerek]
Alright, finally[N]
good to go.[AN]
Hyah![A][X]



## Ch4TodorokiBattle
[MidLeft][LoadTodoroki]
So, you're the ones[N]
who defeated Derek?[AN]
This should be fun.[N]
Come at me![A][X]

## Ch4TodorokiDeath
[MidLeft][LoadTodoroki]
Heh... not too...[N]
shabby... Phew...[A][X]

## Ch4DerekBattle
[MidLeft][LoadDerek]
What the...?![N]
You again?![A][X]

## Ch4DerekDeath
[MidLeft][LoadDerek]
Am I truly...[N]
So weak...?[A][X]

## Ch4EevsterDeath
[MidRight][LoadEevster]
No... I can't...[N]
Fall here... not yet...[A][X]




## Ch4Ending
[MidRight][LoadSanders][Left][LoadFinn][FarLeft][LoadScott]
Looks like we managed[N]
to get her out okay![AN]

[MidRight]
And the information[N]
we were promised?[AN]

[Left]
She left us this note[N]
on her cell floor.[AN]

[MidRight]
Let's see...[A][X]

## Ch4Ending2
To learn more of the holy weapons,[N]
head to the sewers[N]
of the town to the east.[AN]
There you will find what you seek.[N]
Beware of the monsters lurking below.[N]
- Eevster[A][X]

## Ch4Ending3
[Left][LoadFinn][FarLeft][LoadScott][MidRight][LoadSanders]
The town to the[N]
east, huh...[AN]

[Left]
Should we prepare[N]
to move, Sanders?[AN]

[MidRight]
It's not like we have any[N]
other leads. Let's do it.[AN]

[FarLeft][Clear][LoadBrian]
Excuse me, sirs, but I[N]
couldn't help but overhear.[AN]
If it's not too much trouble,[N]
I humbly request to join you.[AN]

[Left]
Whatever for?[AN]

[FarLeft]
You see, I'm something of[N]
a treasure hunter myself.[AN]
Hearing of such stories...[N]
It fascinates me.[AN]

[MidRight]
You were pretty helpful[N]
in that last battle.[AN]
I've no problems with it.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Excellent! I[N]
thank you, sir.[A][X]

## Ch4Ending4
[Left][LoadTodoroki][FarLeft][LoadDerek][MidRight][LoadRaydrik]
So, she[N]
escaped...[AN]

[Left]
My apologies,[N]
Lord Raydrik.[AN]
It seems they were[N]
stronger than I expected.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hmph, fool.[N]
Do not fail me again.[AN]
You as well, Derek.[N]
You both disappoint me.[AN]
[Clear]

[FarLeft]
[Beat][A][X]


## Ch4GetItem
[MidRight][LoadSanders][MidLeft][LoadGreenSoldier]
Excuse me, sir![AN]
My brother was locked up in there.[AN]
I don't know if this is enough,[N]
but please take it. Thank you![A][X]
