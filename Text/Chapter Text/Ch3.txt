Chapter 3: Forest from the Trees[X]

## Ch3Objective
Arrive[X]




## Ch3OP
[Left][LoadSanders][MidRight][LoadWrys]
We're almost[N]
there now.[AN]

[Left]
This forst is so dark...[AN]
Can barely see a foot[N]
in front of my face.[AN]

[MidRight]
It's quite dangerous with[N]
the monsters roaming about.[AN]

[Left]
[Beat]
Reveal yourself.[AN]

[MidRight][Clear][FarLeft][LoadWrys][MidRight][LoadNovala]
You're sharper than[N]
you look, boy.[AN]

[Left]
Who are you?[AN]

[FarLeft]
I recognize those[N]
robes anywhere.[AN]
But why? That cult[N]
should be long gone...[AN]

[MidRight]
Heheheh. Seems you're[N]
older than you should be...[AN]
Perhaps we can[N]
put an end to that.[AN]
[Clear]

[FarLeft]
Careful, Sanders.[AN]
They're going to[N]
attack us with monsters.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadScott]
Then let's proceed[N]
with due caution.[AN]

[Left]
Right. We must move quickly,[AN]
but remember not to get[N]
too ahead of ourselves.[A][X]



## Ch3OP2
[MidLeft][LoadWilbell][MidRight][LoadNeptune]
Just admit it![N]
You're lost.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I am not! We're just...[N]
taking a little detour.[AN]
I'm sure that stupid thing[N]
was around here somewhere...[AN]

[MidRight]
Argh, I knew coming here to see[N]
this dumb weapon was a bad idea...[AN]
It's all dark and cold... And I[N]
think I just saw something moving?![AN]

[MidLeft]
Eek! Don't scare[N]
me like that![AN]

[MidRight]
Just keep to[N]
close to me, kay?[AN]
I've handled my[N]
fair share of baddies![AN]
It would help if[N]
I could see, though...[A][X]



## Ch3PostPrep
[MidLeft][LoadSanders][Right][LoadWilbell][FarRight][LoadNeptune]
Hold on, are[N]
those... people?[AN]

[Right]
Heyyy!![AN]

[MidLeft]
Huh? A couple of girls...[AN]
They don't seem to[N]
be enemies, at least.[AN]

[MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadBlanc]
Neptune? What are[N]
you doing here...?[AN]

[FarRight]
Oh, Blanny! Am I[N]
glad to see you![AN]
Help us out here,[N]
huh? Pretty please?[AN]
I think there's something[N]
scary sulking around...[AN]

[FarLeft]
Hopeless, as always...[AN]
I guess we should[N]
help them, though.[A][X]



## Ch3PostPrep2
[MidRight][LoadNovala]
We cannot allow them to pass alive...[AN]
Hold the forts, my brothers.[N]
Our legions shall soon arrive...[A][X]




## Ch3NovalaBattle
[MidLeft][LoadNovala]
You shall proceed no further...[N]
You shall return to the Earth![A][X]

## Ch3NovalaDeath
[MidLeft][LoadNovala]
This... is...[N]
Urrrgh...[A][X]



## Ch3Ending
[Left][LoadWrys]
Looks like we made it...[N]
and here we are.[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadSanders][Right][LoadNeptune][FarRight][LoadWilbell]
I knew we[N]
were nearby![AN]

[Right]
Right, right...[AN]

[FarLeft]
Surely it wouldn't just be[N]
in this stone case here.[AN]

[Left]
Right you are, Sanders.[N]
It's magically sealed.[AN]
Luckily for us, those cultists[N]
weren't able to see it.[AN]

[FarLeft]
So, how do I[N]
open this thing...[AN]

[FarRight]
I could use some levitation[N]
magic to lift off the lid...[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadMarisa]
C'mon, just bust it[N]
open or something![AN]

[FarLeft]
I guess trying[N]
wouldn't hurt...[AN]
Here goes.[AN]

[Event]

[FarLeft]
So this is a[N]
holy weapon...[AN]

[Left]
This is called Tyrfing,[N]
the holy blade.[AN]

[Right]
Whoa...[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadScott]
It looks[N]
powerful...[AN]

[FarLeft]
Well, we've got the sword.[AN]
Those monsters were pretty[N]
close behind, so let's get going.[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadFinn]
As to the point as ever,[N]
even after all that...[AN]
Alright, everyone, march.[A][X]
